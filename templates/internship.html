Form study groups for consistent motivation\n4. Don't get discouraged by rejections - they're part of the process\n5. Conduct mock interviews with peers to practice communication\n6. Research the company culture and values before interviews\n7. Keep a notebook of patterns you observe in problems\n8. Take care of your health - burnout is real\n9.

If you're stuck, try working with examples or drawing visualizations\n6. Optimize your solution incrementally - start with working code\n7.

Be prepared to discuss technical trade-offs in your solutions\n4. Show enthusiasm for learning and growth, not just technical skills\n5. Have specific examples ready for behavioral questions\n6. Ask thoughtful questions about the team and projects at the end\n7. Follow up with a thank-you email after each interview stage\n8. Be yourself - authenticity comes across well in Microsoft interviews\n9. Don't neglect system design preparation, even for internship roles\n10.

Always start with the fundamental physics and engineering principles\n2. Consider manufacturability from the beginning, not as an afterthought\n3. Create multiple design iterations quickly rather than perfecting one approach\n4. Explicitly state your assumptions and constraints\n5. Consider environmental factors (temperature, vibration, etc.)\n6. Think about failure modes and robustness\n7. Calculate rough estimations to validate your approach\n8. Articulate trade-offs between different design decisions\n9. Consider sustainability and recycling in your designs"

                        "answer": "Tesla was extremely interested in my extracurricular projects - about 70% of the interview focused on these. They specifically asked about:\n\n- My solar car racing team experience\n- Personal projects involving electric motors and batteries\n- My internship at a local manufacturing company\n- Leadership roles in engineering student organizations\n- Competitions I had participated in\n\nThey were less interested in academic performance and more focused on practical, hands-on experience building real things."

                        "answer": "1. Build something tangible that demonstrates your skills - Tesla values makers\n2. Be prepared to defend your design decisions with engineering principles\n3. Show enthusiasm for Tesla's mission - they care about passion\n4. Have examples ready of how you've solved manufacturing challenges\n5. Demonstrate how you've optimized designs for cost and performance\n6. Don't oversell your experience - be honest about what you don't know\n7. Research Tesla's current engineering challenges beforehand\n8. Prepare questions that show you understand the industry's challenges\n9. Practice explaining complex technical concepts simply\n10. Show resilience and ability to iterate quickly - Tesla's pace is extremely fast"
